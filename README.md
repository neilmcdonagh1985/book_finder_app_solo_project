# book_finder_app_solo_project

Used: Ruby, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, html(with erb), CSS. 

This was the first of the projects carried out as part of the CodeClan course, directly following the Ruby stage of the course. It was also my first serious project as a developer. The purpose was to consolidate learning of Ruby and put into practice the aspects of app-building that had been learned so far on the course, such as file structure, handling responsibility, class interactions etc.

The project brief was to design an app to be used by staff/management at a shop to track changes and updates to their inventory.

I chose a book shop as my intended user. My intention was to adhere to the idea that all information should be two clicks away, and have a simple design/presentation which is easy to use. There are also a couple of filter functions (users can search by genre and author). The app also highlights low stock items in red.

Controller and erb files were used to provide the routes. Confirmation pages are rendered when an action is completed, such as a user adding or deleting a book. TDD was used for the basic CRUD functionality.


Things to Improve:

I would like to return to this project to add more functionality such as a function where users can search by typing the name of a book or author, rather than having to scroll through the list.

A book app should ideally contain a serial number or reference.

The app should calculate the biggest-selling books so the shop is informed as to the demand for a book.

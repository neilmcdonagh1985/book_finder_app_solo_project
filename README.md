# book_finder_app_solo_project

Used: Ruby, Sinatra, html(with erb), CSS. 

This was the first of the projects carried out as part of the CodeClan course, directly following the Ruby stage of the course. 
The project brief was to design an app to be used by staff/management at a shop to track changes and updates to their inventory.

I chose a book shop as my intended user. My intention was to adhere to the idea that all information should be two clicks away, and
have a simple design/presentation which is easy to use. There are also a couple of filter functions (by genre and author). The
app also highlights low stock items in red.
